Logging Handler
===============

Rich supplies a :ref:`logging handler<logging>` which will format and colorize text written by Python's logging module.

Here's an example of how to set up a rich logger::

    import logging
    from rich.logging import RichHandler

    FORMAT = "%(message)s"
    logging.basicConfig(
        level="NOTSET", format=FORMAT, datefmt="[%X]", handlers=[RichHandler()]
    )

    log = logging.getLogger("rich")
    log.info("Hello, World!")

Rich logs won't render :ref:`console_markup` in logging by default as most libraries won't be aware of the need to escape literal square brackets, but you can enable it by setting ``markup=True`` on the handler. Alternatively you can enable it per log message by supplying the ``extra`` argument as follows::  

    log.error("[bold red blink]Server is shutting down![/]", extra={"markup": True})


Handle exceptions
-------------------

Rich's :class:`~rich.logging.RichHandler` class can be configured to handle exceptions. Here's an example::

    handler = RichHandler(handle_tracebacks=True)

    try:
        1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        log.exception("Exception message")

There are a number of options you can use to configure logging output, see the :class:`~rich.logging.RichHandler` reference for details.
